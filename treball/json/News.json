        "Content": "Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Cody  Bellinger (shoulder) underwent surgery on Tuesday to fix the right shoulder that he dislocated while celebrating a home run in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series against the Braves. Bellinger will start his rehab in Arizona next week and should be ready for spring training in 2021. The 25-year-old said that doctors popped his shoulder back into place \"real quick\" and he returned to center field to finish the game. He didn't miss any games on the way to beating the Rays in the World Series. Bellinger hit 12 home runs this year and finished with a .239 average and 30 RBI. The power-hitting left-hander was a bit of a disappointment during the regular season, but he remains a high-end fantasy outfielder going into the 2021 season.",

The team also announced the right-hander will undergo Tommy John surgery and miss the 2021 season. Clevinger registered a 2.84 ERA after joining the Friars midseason, but an elbow impingement limited him to just one inning in the playoffs. A rough setback for both the 29-year-old and the Padres lofty expectations, Clevinger should be ready by 2022. Through five big-league seasons, Clevinger possesses a 3.19 ERA, 1.19 WHIP and 10.0 K\/9 but has battled a myriad of injuries. Still a hold in dynasty formats, Clevinger will likely be a risk-reward redraft SP2 once he's deemed healthy.",

The 36-year-old had his $15 million option for 2021 declined, making him a free agent, but he said he prefers to return to the Tampa Bay Rays and keep pitching near his Florida home. Morton plans to \"keep an open mind\" about offers from other teams. The veteran righty finished third in the American League Cy Young voting in 2019 but had a 4.74 ERA (3.45 FIP) in 38 regular season innings this year. Morton has been excellent in the playoffs in his career, but his decline in the shortened 2020 season will have fantasy managers wary that he can be a No. 1 fantasy starter if he returns in 2021.",

With the universal designated hitter in question, the Friars opted against a reasonable $3 million price tag for Moreland, who they acquired via trade in 2020. With the resurgence of incumbent first baseman Eric  Hosmer, Moreland's left-handed bat became redundant. The 35-year-old veteran slashed just .203\/.247\/.362 with two homers in 73 plate appearances in San Diego, while posting a .894 and swatting 10 dingers overall between the Padres and Boston Red Sox. A bonafide slugger, Moreland will surely get another shot somewhere but without bankable playing time, his fantasy viability will be shaky.",

        "Title": "Walker Buehler To Start Game 3 Of World Series",
        "Content": "Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Walker  Buehler will start Game 3 of the World Series against the Rays on Friday. Buehler started Game 1 in the first three rounds of the playoffs, but he just pitched on Saturday in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series. Instead, lefty Clayton  Kershaw will be pitching on normal rest in Game 1 on Tuesday. Buehler will be going on five days of rest on Friday after he tossed six scoreless innings last Saturday against Atlanta. The right-handed Buehler would be set up to start a deciding Game 7, if necessary. Buehler is likely to be matched up against veteran right-hander Charlie  Morton in Game 3 on Friday. He'll be a fine DFS play in the Fall Classic's third game.",
